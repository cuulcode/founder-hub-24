# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons in this folder with the following names and sizes:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- **icon32.png** - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can use any image editor to create these icons. Here are some tips:

1. **Use a square canvas** - All icons should be square (equal width and height)
2. **Simple design** - Icons should be recognizable at small sizes
3. **PNG format** - Save as PNG with transparency if needed
4. **Consistent design** - All sizes should look consistent

## Quick Generation

If you have a single logo image, you can use online tools to resize it:
- [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)
- [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Or use image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or Figma

## Placeholder Icons

If you don't have icons yet, the extension will still work but will use Chrome's default icon. Add your custom icons before publishing to the Chrome Web Store.
